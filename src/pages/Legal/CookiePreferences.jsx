                    <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
                    <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, provide a better user experience, and supply information to the website operators.</p>
                    <p>Vibeo ("Service", "Platform", "we", "us") uses cookies and similar technologies (such as local storage and session storage) to operate essential site functionality, remember your preferences, and understand how you interact with the Platform.</p>
                    <p>This Cookie Policy explains what cookies we use, why we use them, and how you can control your preferences. By continuing to use the Service, you consent to the use of cookies as described in this policy and based on your selections below.</p>

                    <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
                    <p>The cookies used on the Vibeo Platform can be categorized as follows:</p>

                    <h3>Strictly Necessary (Essential) Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies are required for the Platform to function correctly. Without them, you would not be able to sign in, maintain your session, or use core features. These cookies cannot be disabled.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> Maintain your signed-in session via Google Firebase Authentication. Without these, you would need to sign in on every page visit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Session State:</strong> Preserve your current session context as you navigate between pages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Security Cookies:</strong> Help detect and prevent fraudulent activity and protect your account.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Functional (Preference) Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies allow the Platform to remember your choices and provide enhanced, personalized features. Disabling them may result in a degraded experience.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Theme Preferences:</strong> Stores your selected visual theme (Dark, Light, Ocean, Forest, Gold, etc.) so it persists across sessions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Layout Settings:</strong> Remembers your card size, glass level, and metadata display preferences.</li>
                        <li><strong>Background Pattern:</strong> Stores your selected background pattern preference.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cookie Consent:</strong> Remembers your cookie preference selections so you are not asked again on every visit.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Analytics and Performance Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies collect aggregated, anonymous information about how visitors use the Platform. This data helps us understand usage patterns, identify issues, and improve the Service. No personally identifiable information is collected through analytics cookies.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Page Visit Tracking:</strong> Records which pages are visited and how users navigate the Platform.</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> Measures page load times and identifies performance bottlenecks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature Usage:</strong> Tracks which features are most frequently used to guide development priorities.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Marketing and Advertising Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies may be used in the future to deliver relevant advertisements or content recommendations. Currently, Vibeo does not serve third-party advertisements. If this changes, this section will be updated accordingly.</p>

                {/* ── Third-Party Cookies ── */}
                <section>
                    <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Some cookies on the Platform are set by third-party services that we use to operate the Service. These third parties have their own cookie and privacy policies, which we encourage you to review:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> Sets authentication and session management cookies. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> May set cookies related to the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Local Storage and Session Storage</h2>
                    <p>In addition to cookies, Vibeo uses browser local storage and session storage to store certain data on your device. These technologies function similarly to cookies but can store larger amounts of data and are not transmitted to our servers with every request.</p>
                    <p><strong>Data stored in local storage includes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Theme and appearance preferences</li>
                        <li>Layout configuration settings</li>
                        <li>Cookie consent preferences</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Data stored in session storage includes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cached AI recommendation results (cleared when the browser tab is closed)</li>
                        <li>Temporary navigation state</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can clear local and session storage at any time through your browser's developer tools or settings, or by using the "Factory Reset" option in the Settings page.</p>
